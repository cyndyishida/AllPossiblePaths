# AllPossiblePaths

Program that returns all the possible paths from starting vertex to destination vertex in a directed acylic graph. (Though any  acyclic graph would work) thats weighted with possible negative weighted edges.

- written in python
- 2 approaches appear in program, 1 done iteratively and 1 done recursively
- both utilized a brute force depth first search
